# Image Addition with opencv
In this project I combine a lightning image with an image of iron man to create a super cool image in which iron man is standing and lightning is cracking <br>
Raw images: <br>
<br>
<img src = "iron man.jpeg" height = 720px width = 1280px> <br>
<br>
<img src = "lightning.jpeg" height = 720px width = 1280px> <br>
<br>
Final image: <br>
<br>
<img src = "iron man lightning.jpeg" height = 720px width = 1280px>
